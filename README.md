## About

This project consists of my final project for my Web Development II course at the Nashua Community College. This website was written in a two hour sitting without the use of any 3rd party CSS or Javascript frameworks, drafted from a list of random (fake) companies provided by my professor.

## What I learned

* Design responsive first, it's much easier to design responsive first with less content and work into larger view ports. When designing from a larger viewport as your target, it becomes much more difficult to decide what content to strip out and how to structure.
* Never work from a static wireframe, also design from the assumption of dynamic content even if you're provided static data.
* Colors are **important**. **Never** understimate the effects color can have on a given webpage. Colors can help guide the user's focus, suggest feelings and emotions, and more important make content easier to consume.
